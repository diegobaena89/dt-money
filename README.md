This is a project created for a challenge. The project consists in an application where the user can manage his finances in a simpler way.

The user is able to create new cash incomes or outcomes. The entire application was created with user accessibility in mind with tools like radix-ui.

In addition, to create the app, we use React, Typescript, React-hook-form technologies, among others.
